### ♿ Accessibility Testing with axe-core

The starter template comes with [axe-core](https://larsmagnus.co/blog/how-to-test-for-accessibility-with-axe-core-in-next-js-and-react) pre-integrated. To use it:

1. 🔍 Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. 📝 Check the Console tab while using your app
3. 🛠️ Review and fix accessibility errors that appear (ignore minor errors)

### 🔄 Manual Testing

- ⌨️ Test your app with keyboard navigation (if applicable)
- 🔊 Add appropriate ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility

### 🤖 AI-Powered Review
